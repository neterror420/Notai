What can you do to improve Notai?

* There are some things you can do to help us make Notai better. Check the list below.

### 1. Teach Notai new things. He will learn from you.
Try to ask him questions. If he doesn't have an answer, you can teach him. Let's say you ask him "What am I?" and he tells you he doesn't understand what you just said.

###### What should you do?

Well, you can **tell him the right answer**. If the answer for the question "Who am I" was "a human", you should tell him


``` "No, the answer is a human"``` or just ```"The answer is a human"```.


### 2. Suggest features

If there's anything that you would want to see Notai do, well, you can always suggest a new feature.

[Here](https://neterror.pw/)'s a form that you could use. If we add your suggestion, you can get credits for that if you want.

### 3. Talk with him

Notai will remember what you tell him. If he says something wrong and you tell him he's stupid, he will understand that he did a mistake.



## The future of Notai

Notai could even be a virtual assistant on your phone in the future. We still improve it.

## Open source or not?
We don't plan making Notai open-source because people would rebrand it and create their own bots that would simply use the unchanged Notai's code. However, in the future we may create a special open-source version of Notai that will only have basic things. We still have to focus on making the actual Notai better and better before we relase any open-source version.


## Updates
You can always see what's new on https://neterror.pw/blog. We post there every thing we add.

## The darkmode
You can tell Notai ```Enable darkmode```. See what happens.

(You can disable it with ```Disable darkmode```).
